# Buddy-Prototype1-
Buddy is an (or going to be) an interactive robot. This is just the first Prototype i have made. I made it during my holidays 
It took me no more than 1 hour. There is nothing to much to this prototype rather than his rude intro and his Serial monitor
communication. He can answer questions which you type in the serial monitor. The questions are also specific. You can check my instructable for more information. I hope that you mess with the code and make it better. If you choose to mess with the code
send it to me.

Happy Programming!!
